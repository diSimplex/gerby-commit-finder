# PyTest failure analysis

This directory contains the successive sequence of pytests run against the
evolving PlasTeX code base.

For each attempt each of the pytest failures are captured together with
their failure reports.

For each failure report there is a short analysis and a link to a
discussion of a potential solution.

The collection of potential solutions can be found in the `solutions`
directory.
