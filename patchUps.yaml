    PlasTeX has a new VerbatimEnvironment which is inturn based upon the

    This is what PlasTeX has done.
    This NEEDS TESTING

filesChanged/plasTeX/Base/LaTeX/Index.py:
  details: |
    Most of these patches unwind themselves....
    HOWEVER the effect of these patches is to comment out the textContent

  patch: handPatches/plasTeX/Base/LaTeX/Index.py.diff

filesChanged/plasTeX/Base/LaTeX/Math.py:
  details: |
    Most of these patches turn off charsubs.

    Added NoCharSubCommand (to mirror the NoCharSubEnvironment)
    Added modifier command to (locally) turn off charSub
    PlasTeX has radically changed code the "TheCounter::Invoke" (line 1684) see 2017_10_08-09_20_16-9f7bb50
    Check 2018_02_05-14_36_49-a0abec7
    For some reason NoCharSubEnvironment has been duplicated at lines 950 and 1042
    2018_02_20-15_33_38-b65433a.diff unwound the duplicates
  patch: handPatches/plasTeX/__init__.py.diff

filesChanged/plasTeX/plastex:
  details: |
    plastex has been renamed client and various of the code moved elsewhere
    `run` has been moved to `Compile.py`
    2018_05_05-01_04_54-2bb10f0 adds a check for empty output directory
      unfortunately this check seriously changes the command line "interface"
      so we have ignored this patch
    2018_05_05-16_02_43-9c510b6 makes a very minor change to the log info
      so we have ignored this patch

filesChanged/plasTeX/ConfigManager/Generic.py:
  details: |
    PlasTeX has removed the ConfigManager/Generic.py
    This has been replaced by a ConfigManager.py
